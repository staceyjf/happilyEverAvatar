      <p>This project was created as part of nology's pre-course challenges. It was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Instant-ID.</p>
      <p>The aim was to have a web app dedicated to fun while learning more about working with open source API models and practicing API calls.</p>

      <p>
        With OpenAI being behind a paywall, I wanted to explore using other source and stumbled around replicate.com which has a range of exciting Opensourced models to play around with.
