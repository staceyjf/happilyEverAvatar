        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>This project was created as part of nology's pre-course challenges. It was crafted using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Instant-ID AI via the Replicate API. The primary goal was to develop a web app dedicated to AI while learning more about working with open source API  and practicing API calls. </p>

        <h2>AI Models</h2>
        <p>As I was also keen to explore alternatives to OpenAI, it was a great chance for me to play around with replicate.com, which offers a range of exciting open-sourced models to integrate into your web projects.</p>

            <p class="diagram_text">Replicate is a cloud-based platform designed to simplify the execution of machine learning models. With just a few lines of codes, users can run open-source models via API support or directly from their code, eliminating the need for extensive machine learning knowledge or additional server setup.</p>

        <h2>Where to start</h2>
        <p>This project has reinforced the importance of consulting documentation. From authentication to getting a predication, the HTTP API reference helped to work out the parameters of my request including endpoints, authorization requirements and request inits.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <h4>1. Overcoming CORS</h4>
        <p>As I have mainly worked on fullstack projects with APIs, this was the first time I encountered a CORS policy error: No "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header. It seems like a common problem faced with beginner engineers so there was lots of support on possible fixes. The route I decided to go down was creating my own proxy server with the help of cors-anywhere and deployed via Heroku.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Testing out the AI via cURL</h4>
        <p>At first, I set up my "Post" request via teh browser's Fetch API and I was having trouble with authorization. I switched to cURL and then utilized the exact example that was given in the documentation.   </p>

        <h2>Helpful Tools</h2>
        <p>Upon looking for solutions to the barriers that I encountered along the way, I came across these great articles on different tools which I integrated into the main project</p>
